    Misc
        loosely typed
        dynamic
        functions are objects
            - functions can be created using function expression
            - functions can have attributes
            - functions can have methods
            - function can be passed as arguments
            - function can be returned as return values
            - functions can be variadic

            - implicit values passed to a function by default
                - this
                    is NOT based on where the function is / who owns the function
                    IS based on how the function is invoked
        
                - arguments
                    array like object
                        arguments[0]
                        arguments[1]
                        length

            Invocation patterns
                - As a method of an object
                    this -> object
                
                - As a function
                    this -> global (window)

                - Using the 'call' method of the function
                - Using the 'apply' method of the function

                
            


Class Employee
    int id;
    string name;
    decimal salary;


Employee emp = new Employee();
emp.id = 100;
emp.city = 'Bangalore';
